A resource hub for patients who will be undergoing cataract surgery.

As an former ophthalmic professional who has counseled hundreds of patients for cataract surgery, a common theme I've noticed is that patients are presented with so much new information within ~1 hour span of time, that they often need this information reiterated a second or even third time after leaving their appointment. Choosing an intraocular lens implant for cataract surgery is a weighty decision which concerns many factors. My goal is to create a resource hub to break down in detail the important pieces of this process, as well as the most common questions I've encountered throughout my career: 

• Cataracts:
  -What are cataracts?
  -What are the different types of cataracts?
  -How do different types of cataracts impact surgical outcomes?

• Cataract Consultation:
  -What can you expect at your first cataract consultation?
  -What questions should you come prepared to ask? 

• Intraocular Lens Implant (IOL) Choices:
  -What intraocular lens implants are currently available on the market?
  -How do I choose my lens implant?
  -What type of vision can I expect with each implant?
  -Can my IOL ever be replaced?

• The Surgical Process:
  -How should I prepare for cataract surgery?
  -What are the risks?
  
• Vision Outcomes:
  -Should I expect "20/20" vision after surgery?
  -How do I judge the success of my cataract surgery?
  -What options do I have if I'm unhappy with the outcome?
